This application provides a way to interface the following Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models:

1. [Tesseract](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js) - A javascript library that gets words in almost any language out of images.
2. [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision?hl=en) - A readily available API (REST and RPC) that allows developers to easily integrate common vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.
3. [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) - Aims to create multilingual, awesome, leading, and practical OCR tools that help users train better models and apply them into practice.

## Project Status

Currently, this project is still unfinished and is a work-in-progress build. As of now, this project is able to upload, scan, and format notes using only 2 out of the 3 OCR models (Tesseract & Google Vision API).

## Project Tasks

The following are things that are to be implemented in the near future:

### Server-Side

- <b>PaddleOCR</b> Implementation

### Client-Side

- User <font color="#6ea8fe">Preference</font> Tab

### Research

- Extensive <font color="#ffda6a">Testing</font>
  - Needs google drive folder for images to test
